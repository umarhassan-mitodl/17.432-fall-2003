Levy, Jack S. "The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace." *Annual Review of Political Science* 1 (1998): 139-165.   
These readings by Jack Levy are the best surveys of hypotheses on war's causes.

Jervis, Robert. "Theories of War in an Era of Leading-Power Peace." *American Political Science Review* 96, no. 1 (March 2002): 1-14.   
An application of broad families of theories of war to explain the current deep peace among great powers.

I also recommend that you take a look at Gregg Cashman, *What Causes War?* for this course as a recommended reading. A good basic synopsis.

*Hypotheses on Military Power-factors as Causes of War* (i.e., Theories Addressing the Fine-grained Structure of Power) (120 pages)

Schelling, Thomas C. "The Dynamics of Mutual Alarm." In *Arms and Influence*. New Haven, CT: Yale, 1966, pp. 221-251.   
The classic statement of "stability theory"--"war is more likely when the side moving first gains an advantage."

Levy, Jack S. "Declining Power and the Preventive Motivation for War." *World Politics* 40, no. 1 (October 1987): 82-107.   
"Windows" of opportunity and vulnerability cause war; such "preventive" wars are common.

Van Evera, Stephen. "Offense, Defense, and the Causes of War." In *The Use of Force*. 5th ed. Edited by Robert J. Art and Kenneth N. Waltz. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1999. ISBN: 9780847695546.   
A statement of "offense-defense theory," and three single-case-study tests. Is this the way theories should be framed and tested?

Jervis, Robert. "Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma." *World Politics* 30, no. 2 (January 1978): 167-214.   
The first development of offense-defense theory. The theory is now a centerpiece in security studies, the article is a classic. My piece, "Offense, Defense," subsumes most of it but you should pass your eyes across it nevertheless. Please skim pp. 167-185, focus on pp. 186-214.

In {{% resource_link "54e5ea84-662a-451e-ac3b-6d6eabfe67aa" "*The Cold War and After: Prospects for Peace*" %}}. Expanded ed. Edited by Sean M. Lynn-Jones and Steven E. Miller. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993, pp. 193-203. ISBN: 9780262620888.   
An application of offense-defense theory.

Blainey, Geoffrey. "Dreams and Delusions of a Coming War." Chapter 3 in *The Causes of War*. 3rd ed. New York, NY: Free Press, 1988. ISBN: 9780029035917.   
False optimism as a cause of war.

Ziegler, David W. "Disarmament." Chapter 10 in *War, Peace and International Politics*. 6th ed. New York, NY: HarperCollins, 1993, pp. 183-204. ISBN: 9780673522870.   
A very basic discussion of a basic proposal--but what's wrong with it? What implicit hypotheses does it rest on? How could they be tested?

Rees, Martin. *Our Final Hour: A Scientist's Warning: How Terror, Error, and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind's Future in this Century--On Earth and Beyond*. New York, NY: Basic Books, 2003, pp. 41-60. ISBN: 9780465068623.   
The advance of science has a horrendous byproduct: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized, says Rees: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non-state organizations or individuals. Hence the pacifying effects that WMD have so far produced will be reversed as humans invent more potent means of mass destruction. What will result? A vast outbreak of preventive wars of counter-proliferation? What can be done to address this danger?

Hypotheses on Systemic Power Factors, and Hypotheses on National Misperception
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

*Hypotheses on Systemic Power Factors (i.e., Theories Addressing the Gross Structure of Power) (162 pages)*

Waltz, Kenneth N. "Structural Causes and Military Effects." In *Theory of International Politics*. New York, NY: Longman Press, 1979, pp. 161-176. ISBN: 9780201083491.   
Pages 176-193 are also included in your coursenotes, but you can skim them quickly; I include them just to give you the whole chapter for your files.

Gilpin, Robert. "Equilibrium and Decline," (pp. 156-185) and "Hegemonic Change and War" (pp. 186-210). In *War and Change in World Politics*. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1983. ISBN: 9780521273763.   
In pages 156-186 Gilpin argues that dominant states are often overtaken by challengers; in pages 186-210 he argues that these power-transitions cause war.

![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif) Mearsheimer, John. "Back to the Future: Instability in Europe After the Cold War." In {{% resource_link "54e5ea84-662a-451e-ac3b-6d6eabfe67aa" "*The Cold War and After: Prospects for Peace*" %}}. Expanded ed. Edited by Sean M. Lynn-Jones and Steven E. Miller. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993, pp. 147-155, 165-167, 176-187. ISBN: 9780262620888.   
Mearsheimer endorses power-based explanations for war, attacks other explanations. Note: you should skim the rest of the article to get Mearsheimer's whole drift.

Wendt, Alexander. "Anarchy Is What States Make of It: The Social Construction of Power Politics." *International Organization* 46, no. 2 (Spring 1992): 391-425.   
A prominent dissent from the realists assigned above.

*Hypotheses on National Misperception: Hypotheses from Psychology; and Structural and Societal Theories of Misperception*

Hypotheses from psychology (43 pages):

Jervis, Robert. "Hypotheses on Misperception." In *International Politics: Enduring Concepts and Contemporary Issues*. 3rd ed. Edited by Robert J. Art and Robert Jervis. New York, NY: Harper Collins, 1991, pp. 472-489. ISBN: 9780673521613.   
A classic discussion of the delusions to which states are prone. Is Jervis' list of myopias a good one? Do they arise from the psychological causes he stresses, or from others? How could his hypotheses be tested?

———. *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1976, pp. 58-84. ISBN: 9780691100494.   
Some argue that using carrots solves conflicts while using sticks provokes them, others say the opposite (warning against appeasement). How can this dispute be resolved? Does Jervis say enough to resolve it? Note: pages 85-113 are also included in your coursenotes but you can skim them quickly; I include them just to give you the whole chapter for your files.

The existing literature on misperception from the psychology paradigm asks if policy makers make the cognitive errors of ordinary people. Do we need work on whether some political systems select elites in ways that over-represent certain psychological disorders--e.g., narcissism, compulsive-obsessive disorder, megalomania, paranoia--that have effects on state perceptions and foreign policy behavior?

Societal theories of misperception: militarism, nationalism, defects in academe and the press (27 pages):

A snippet by an eminent IR theorist to raise the question of dysfunction in academe and academic responsibility for national misperception. Note: to keep your files complete I include the whole piece in your coursenotes (pp. 63-79) but you needn't bother with pp. 63-68, 75-79.

Wildavsky, Aaron. "The Self-Evaluating Organization." *Public Administration Review* (September/October 1972): 509-520.

An excellent short survey of the status of democratic peace theory.

A key piece that helped re-start discussion of democratic peace theory.

Walt, Stephen M. "Revolution and War." *World Politics* 44, no. 3 (April 1992): 321-368.   
Revolutions and revolutionary states cause war, for a range of reasons.

Focus on 34-49, skim the rest. A good distillation of Marxist theories of imperialism, hence of war, since Marxists saw imperialism as the taproot of war.

Harris, Louis. "The Gender Gulf," *New York Times*, December 7, 1990, p. A35.   
A good basic summary of feminist arguments on the causes of war, and some striking data supporting arguments that the genders differ sharply on the use of force. (We need a systematic summary of evidence on this question.)

Fukuyama, Francis. "Women and the Evolution of World Politics." *Foreign Affairs* 77, no. 5 (September/October 1998): 24-40.   
Men are hard-wired to be violent--so let's put them in charge!

![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif) Mueller, John. "The Essential Irrelevance of Nuclear Weapons: Stability in the Postwar World." In {{% resource_link "54e5ea84-662a-451e-ac3b-6d6eabfe67aa" "*The Cold War and After: Prospects for Peace*" %}}. Expanded ed. Edited by Sean M. Lynn-Jones and Steven E. Miller. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993, pp. 45-69. ISBN: 9780262620888.   
War has been delegitimated, much as slavery was before it. Even conventional war is now a fading institution.

![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif) Kaysen, Carl. "Is War Obsolete?" In {{% resource_link "54e5ea84-662a-451e-ac3b-6d6eabfe67aa" "*The Cold War and After: Prospects for Peace*" %}}. Expanded ed. Edited by Sean M. Lynn-Jones and Steven E. Miller. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993, pp. 81-103. ISBN: 9780262620888.   
Mueller is right for the wrong reasons. War is obsolete because it has lost its utility, not because it horrifies anyone.

Levy, Jack S. "The Diversionary Theory of War: A Critique." In *Handbook of War Studies*. Edited by Manus I. Midlarsky. Boston, MA: Unwin Hyman, 1989, pp. 259-288. ISBN: 9780044970552.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993, pp. 211-218. ISBN: 9780262620888.   
On social stratification, democracy, revolution, and capitalism.

Axelrod, Robert. *The Evolution of Cooperation*. New York, NY: Basic Books, 1985, pp. vii-54, 73-87, 109-141. ISBN: 9780465021215.   
Would the prescriptions offered here work if applied by foreign policymakers? If not, why not?

Siverson, Randolph M., and Paul F. Diehl. "Arms Races, the Conflict Spiral, and the Onset of War." In *Handbook of War Studies*. Edited by Manus I. Midlarsky. Boston, MA: Unwin Hyman, 1989, pp. 195-218. ISBN: 9780044970552.   
A criticism of the argument that arms races cause war.

Mesquita, Bruce Bueno de. "The Contribution of Expected Utility Theory to the Study of International Conflict." In *The Origins and Prevention of Major Wars*. Edited by Robert I. Rotberg and Theodore K. Rabb. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 53-76. ISBN: 9780521379557.   
A synopsis of the thought of this prominent rational-choice theorist of war's causes.

*Emotions and War: the Role of Vengeance, Contempt, Honor, Contrition, Apology, Insult, Pride*

Needed: a more developed literature on this topic. A useful introduction (but not assigned) is   
Petersen, Roger D. *Understanding Ethnic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and Resentment in Twentieth-Century Eastern Europe*. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 17-84. ISBN: 9780521007740.

*Religion and war*

Cox, Harvey. "A Challenge to People of All Faiths." In *Restoring Faith: America's Religious Leaders Answer Terror with Hope*. Edited by Forrest Church. New York, NY: Walker, 2001, pp. 161-165. ISBN: 9780802776327.   
Cox argues that all religious traditions are tainted with violent teachings that can dominate the tradition unless they are managed. "They lie there like dry tinder, and any spark could set them ablaze" (p. 164). Cox urges that we work to identify the factors that tempt people to use their scripture to justify hatred and brutality. Do we need more work on this subject? Do we also need work on how people of good will can redirect the terms of debate within religious movements that have become morally unhinged?

Benjamin, Daniel, and Steven Simon. *The Age of Sacred Terror*. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster, 2002, pp. 38-55, 62-68, 91-94, 419-446. ISBN: 9780375508592.   
Pages 38-55, 62-68, 91-94 describe the Islamist currents of thinking that spawned Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's violence stems from a stream of Islamist thought going back to ibn Taymiyya, a bellicose Islamic thinker from the 13th century; to Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the harsh and rigid shaper of modern Saudi Arabian Islam; to Rashid Rida (1866-1935) and Hassan al-Banna (?-1949); and above all to Sayyid Qutb (?-1966), the shaper of modern Islamism. Taymiyya, al-Wahhab and Qutb are covered here. Covered also (pp. 91-94) is the frightening rise of apocalyptic thinking in the Islamic world. What causes the murderous thinking described here?   
Pages 419-446 cover the phenomenon of millenarianism--apocalyptic thinking--in other religions--Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity. This violent, even genocidal, form of religious thought has appeared widely in the last two decades. Why? How can it be tamed before it is used to justify great horrors?

Mishra, Pankaj. "The Other Face of Fanaticism," *New York Times Magazine*, February 2, 2003.   
The Hindu extremist movement of India is painted here, lest anyone think the Muslim world has a corner on murderous religious fanaticism. Is more work needed on the subject of religion and war? Why is good work on the subject scarce?

*Civil War: how Common (very!) What do we know about its Causes and Cures? (Not much!) (69 pages)*

Wallensteen, Peter, and Margaret Sollenberg. "Armed Conflict 1989-99." *Journal of Peace Research* 37, no. 5 (September 2000): 635-649.   
Nearly all wars today are civil wars.

Kaufmann, Chaim. "Possible and Impossible Solutions to Civil War." *International Security* 20, no. 4 (Spring 1996): 136-175.   
When are civil conflicts insoluble? What should we do when they are? Kaufmann's solution outrages many.

Kumar, Radha. "The Troubled History of Partition." *Foreign Affairs* 76, no. 1 (January/February 1997): 22-34.   
An answer to Kaufmann.

Walter, Barbara F. "The Critical Barrier to Civil War Settlement." *International Organization* 51, no. 3 (Summer 1997): 335-364.   
Civil wars are harder to settle than interstate wars, but why? Walter has an answer, and important prescriptions.

A survey of these and other hypotheses on the causes of ethnic conflict.

*The Correlates of War Project: Inferring Theories from large-n Data Sets*

Singer, J. David. "Correlates of War." In *Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict*. 3 vols. Edited by Lester Kurtz. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1999, pp. 1:463-471. ISBN: 9780122270109.   
Singer's summary of his Correlates of War project. Singer does not use the case method; rather, he seeks correlations in large-n data sets, hoping that correlation will sometimes signal causation. How fruitful is this approach? When should it be used?

Fortna, Page. "What We Know from the Numbers: The Quantitative Literature on Civil and Interstate War." (Manuscript: 2003).

A syllabus on qualitative methods from the Arizona State University Qualitative Methods Institute (January 2002); and syllabi on the case study method by professors Scott Sagan (Stanford), John Mearsheimer (Chicago), Andrew Bennett (Georgetown), John Odell (USC), Matthew Evangelista (Cornell), Ted Hopf (Michigan). In the past many political science departments defined "methodology" to consist solely of large-n (statistical) methods. While statistics was a required course at most schools, case study methodology often wasn't even taught. This is changing, as these syllabi illustrate. I include them for your general perusal and background. No need to give them a talmudic reading--they are for your reference.

Those curious to see more qualitative methods syllabi can find them on the web at {{% resource_link "cf53c8e7-d976-4452-87b4-08d0367a0c89" "Syllabi" %}}. And for more on qualitative methods see {{% resource_link "feafed3d-68d8-4df1-babc-1268fa3a54c2" "Consortium ON Qualitative Research Methods (CQRM)" %}}.

Syllabi on the causes of war for courses taught by Jack Levy (Rutgers), Christopher Gelpi (Harvard), Stephen Walt (Chicago), Hayward Alker (USC), Louise Hodgden (Texas/Austin), and Dale Copeland U. of Virginia). How the subject is taught elsewhere, by a diverse range of scholars. For your reference. (Handy to have for the day when you have to design your own version of this course.)

Smoke, Richard. "The Seven Years War." In *War: Controlling Escalation*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978, pp. 195-236. ISBN: 9780674945951.   
A good historical synopsis. What general theories of war causes does his account support?

Higonnet, Patrice. "The Origins of the Seven Years War." *Journal of Modern History* 40 (1968): 57-90.   
A striking revelation on the war's origins that changed historical understanding--200 years after the fact.

*Korea*

Whiting, Allen S. "The U.S. China War in Korea." In *Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management*. Edited by Alexander L. George. Boulder, CO: Westview, 1991, pp. 103-125. ISBN: 9780813312330.   
A synoptic account.

World War I
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Joll, James. *The Origins of the First World War*. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Longman, 1992, pp. 1-241 (entire). ISBN: 9780582089204.   
The most widely-used synopsis of the outbreak of the war.

Geiss, Imanuel. *German Foreign Policy, 1871-1914*. Boston, MA: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1976, pp. vii-ix, 121-127, 142-150, 206-207. ISBN: 9780710083036.   
This book summarizes the views of the "Fischer School," which argues that German aggression was a prime cause of World War I. Pages 142-150 recounts the occurrence and aftermath of the War Council of 8 December 1912, a centerpiece of the Fischer school case; pages 206-207 reprint the Fischer school's "smoking gun" diary entry by Admiral Müller, discovered only in the 1960s. But many find Fisher and Geiss unpersuasive. How can this dispute be resolved?

Strachan, Hew. *The First World War*. Vol. 1: To Arms. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2001, 51 (bottom)-55 (bottom). ISBN: 9780198208778.   
Strachan, an anti-Fischerite, thinks that the December 8 1912 War Council was no war council at all, but rather an indecisive bull session of sorts. Are his reasons persuasive?

Kitchen, Martin. "The Army and the Idea of Preventive War," and "The Army and the Civilians." Chapters 5 and 6 in *The German Officer Corps, 1890-1914*. Oxford, England: Clarendon, 1968, pp. 96-142. ISBN: 9780198214670.   
In Germany the army purveyed the concept of preventive war, the notion that war was healthy and beneficial, and other exotic ideas; and within Germany it became a law unto itself--a "state within the state," in Gordon Craig's phrase.

Miller, Steven E., et. al., eds. *Military Strategy and the Origins of the First World War*. Revised ed. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1985, pp. xi-xix, 20-133. (Snyder, Van Evera, and Sagan.) ISBN: 9780691022321.   
A Europe-wide cult of the offensive caused World War I--or did it?

Langsam, Walter Consuelo. "Nationalism and History in the Prussian Elementary Schools Under William II." In *Nationalism and Internationalism: essays inscribed to Carlton J. H. Hayes*. Edited by Edward Mead Earle. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 1950, pp. 241-260.   
German elementary and high schools were channels of nationalist propaganda.

Snyder, Louis L. "Historiography," and "Militarism." Chapters 6 and 10 in *German Nationalism: Tragedy of a People*. Port Washington, NY: Kennikat, 1969. ISBN: 9780804604338.   
Please read pp. 123-24, mid-139-152, 227-243; you need only skim pp. 124-139, 243-254. German historians were more a problem than a solution; German popular thought was militarized.

A good mainstream historical synopsis.

Herwig, Holger. "Clio Deceived: Patriotic Self-Censorship in Germany After the Great War." In *Military Strategy and the Origins of the First World War*. Edited by Miller. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1985, pp. 262-301. ISBN: 9780691022321.   
How Germans mis-remembered the origins and aftermath of the First World War.

Wette, Wolfram. "From Kellogg to Hitler (1928-1933). German Public Opinion Concerning the Rejection or Glorification of War." In *The German Military in the Age of Total War*. Edited by Wilhelm Deist. Dover, NH: Berg, 1985, pp. 71-99. ISBN: 9780907582144.   
How Germans came to love war again so soon after the Marne and Verdun. What explains the bizarre developments Wette describes?

Berman, Sheri. *The Social Democratic Moment: Ideas and Politics in the Making of Interwar Europe*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998, pp. ix-x, 176-200. ISBN: 9780674442610.   
Why did the Great Depression of the 1930s bring benign Social Democrats to power in Sweden while bringing the vicious and expansionist Nazis to power in Germany? Clearly, the effects of depressions on modern industrial politics are not uniform; instead, a condition variable of some sort must decide these effects. Clearly, that condition variable must have had very different values in the Swedish and German cases. Berman's study tries to identify that condition variable. Does she do so persuasively?

Was the Japanese decision for war a rational response to circumstances, or in some sense "irrational"? Ienaga and Sagan disagree--who's right?

Utley, Jonathan G. *Going to War With Japan 1937-1941*. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1985, pp. 151-156. ISBN: 9780870494451.

Was the crucial American decision to cut off oil exports to Japan taken by a bureaucracy out of control? Utley and Heinrichs disagree. How can this mystery be unravelled?

A famous history by a great strategist that many later readers, across many centuries, felt evoked their own times and tragedies.

Please focus on pp. 347-349, where Kagan debunks several explanations for the Peloponnesian war, and skim the rest. Kagan evaluates several contending explanations by framing and assessing their predictions. (His inferred predictions are implicit but clear nevertheless.) Does his method work?
